- mobile view
- add helmet

- should direct onto projects be totally collapsed or all shown?

- remove building types as filter from both primary filters
- have building types show up in each _individual_ project description, and people can click on the building type there as a filter - maybe click on it and then that resets all filters to only have that building type as a filter. Come up with a way to show that such a filter has being selected (maybe collapse capabilities)?
- have some graphic visual thing for front page - sean mentioned something to do with sketch, drawing? Not entirely sure what he was referring to

HARDCODED:
